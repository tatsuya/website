<h2>Hi there, Iâ€™m Tatsuya ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer from Japan currently living and working in New York. Iâ€™m a senior backend engineer at <a href="https://qz.com" target="_blank">Quartz</a>, where I lead the design and development of the backend systems that drive the Quartzâ€™s website and iOS app. This work includes the launch of <a href="https://qz.com/members/" target="_blank">Quartz membership</a>, Quartzâ€™s first paid subscription service, and the U.S. expansion of <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/newspicks" target="_blank">NewsPicks</a>, the leading business news platform in Japan that was integrated into Quartz after <a href="https://qz.com/1319054/quartz-sold-by-atlantic-media-to-uzabase-of-japan/" target="_blank">the M&A</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to the media industry, I was a backend engineer at <a href="https://www.gilt.jp/" target="_blank">GILT</a>, a flash sale site specializing in luxury apparel, and <a href="https://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/" target="_blank">Rakuten</a>, Japanâ€™s largest B-to-C and C-to-C e-commerce platform, where I worked on developing services such as product listings, membership and payments, as well as DevOpts for a large-scale, self-service, distributed search platform.</p>
